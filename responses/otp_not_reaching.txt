📱 When OTP is not reaching the customer's mobile

1️⃣ Verify SMS reception

Confirm if the customer receives SMS from any sender.

2️⃣ Check sender-specific blocking

If other SMS are received, verify whether messages from Anbesabank / LIB / 8803 are blocked on the customer’s device.

If blocked, unblock immediately.

3️⃣ Ensure phone accessibility

If not blocked, confirm the customer’s phone is reachable for both calls and SMS (network coverage, SIM active, not in airplane mode).

4️⃣ Validate head office SMS service

If all above checks pass, confirm whether SMS service is temporarily stopped at the Head Office.

⚠️ Note: This occurs in <2% of cases, so check steps 1–3 first.
